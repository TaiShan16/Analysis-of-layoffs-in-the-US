# Analysis-of-layoffs-in-the-US(2020-2023)
#### Project 1 - 

In this project, we will utilize a dataset sourced from Kaggle. Our initial steps will involve exploring, cleaning, and reformatting the data prior to addressing our research questions.

Our work will be meticulously documented in a Jupyter notebook, with our analysis employing a variety of techniques. These will include aggregation, correlation, comparison, summary statistics, sentiment analysis, and time-series analysis utilizing the scipy.stats module.

To elucidate insights and intriguing trends within the data, we will incorporate graphical representations during both the exploration and analysis phases.

### Research Questions to Answer

#### Research Question 1:
- Which industries experienced the highest number of layoffs in the years 2022 and 2023?
- The trend line in a line graph is utilized to observe the changes in layoffs across different industries over the years.
- A pie chart is used to represent the distribution of layoffs among industries in a specific year, or to compare the distribution over a span of four years.
            


#### Research Question 2: 
- Is there a correlation between the layoff rate and the specific states in the US?  
- Which state has experienced the highest number of layoffs?
 


#### Research Question 3: 
- Is there a higher incidence of layoffs in companies pre-IPO or post-IPO? 
- At which stage prior to the IPO do companies experience the most layoffs? (This will be represented in a histogram.)
 


#### Research Question 4: 
- Does the amount of funds raised impact the layoff rates?
